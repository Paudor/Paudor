- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paudor
- 👀 I’m interested in pure mathematics, specifically algebraic geometry, but I also have a growing interest in cryptography, cloud architecture, and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning toric geometry, tropical geometry, cryptography, and the fundamentals of data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data cleaning or encryption/decryption algorithms.
